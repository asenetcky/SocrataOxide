# SocrataOxide

My take on one of my favorite R packages RSocrata, but rebuilt using Rust.

## Why?

RSocrata is a package I use all the time
in my personal life and my professional life.
I've been learning a bit of Rust and
I wanted to take something I was familiar with in R
and rebuild it in Rust.
